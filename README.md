Arbitrary Precision Calculator (APC)


Overview
The Arbitrary Precision Calculator (APC) is a command-line based calculator that performs high-precision mathematical operations, surpassing the limitations of typical floating-point arithmetic. The APC is implemented in C and designed to run on Linux-based systems (e.g., Ubuntu). This calculator can handle extremely large integers, rational numbers, and floating-point numbers with high precision.


APC supports basic arithmetic operations, advanced functions like trigonometry and logarithms, and even allows for custom precision levels defined by the user.



Features
Arbitrary Precision Arithmetic: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on numbers with virtually no upper limit to precision.
Support for Large Integers: Work with integers that are much larger than what standard int or long types can handle.
Rational and Floating-Point Numbers: Handle both rational numbers and floating-point numbers with high precision.
Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.



Custom Precision: Define the precision of your calculations (up to hundreds or thousands of decimal places).
Error Handling: Handles common errors such as division by zero and invalid inputs.
